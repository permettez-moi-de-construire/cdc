üöß TODO: generate with OpenAPI using zod

On each subscription, a Webhook record is inserted in database and a Queue is created.

### Post

Each webhook subscription Queue is consumed. When an event incomes, the underlying webhook is called.

See [api](#api) for the payload schema.

with an increasing delay each time defined in `AMQP_REQUEUE_DELAYS` environment variable.
